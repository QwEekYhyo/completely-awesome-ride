# Session 5 report

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last session I modified my code for it to run on Arduino and this allowed me to move to the arduino IDE and make the first .ino file of the project. I obviously ran into a few problems because I was still using iostream (to show the game on a terminal) so I had to get rid of it and I adapted the code in order to display the game on the marvelous LED matrix extremely well welded by Saveria. Because we do not have the button setup yet I made it so you can play via the serial monitor of Arduino.
I also changed the code so that it uses a cursor (imagine it on top of the columns) and you can move it left or right, then hit validate and it plays on the selected column (because it will be this way in the end).
So here is how it looks like (sorry for the poor quality) :

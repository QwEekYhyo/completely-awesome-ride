# Session 2 report

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This time the tears were tears of joy, because my partner recovered from her disease.
Thanks to this we were able start prototyping and think about how we would be doing everything. I’ll let her describe more in detail what we came up with and I am going to explain the code I wrote.
Since last time I implemented the algorithm to check the winner. You can imagine it as a star around every coin placed (horizontal line, vertical line and 2 diagonal lines) and we make segments
of 4 on each line and the segment move along the line to check 4 by 4. The horizontal and vertical lines were pretty easy to code but I wasn’t expecting the diagonals to be this hard, it took me a lot of time.
